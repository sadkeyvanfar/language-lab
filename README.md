# üß™ Language Lab

**Status:** üõ†Ô∏è *Active ‚Äì Educational Sample Code Repository*

---

## Overview

**Language Lab** is a curated collection of **simple and educational sample programs** organized by language. It‚Äôs designed to help learners explore and compare the **basics of programming syntax and features** across multiple languages.

---

## Project Structure

Each language folder contains topics such as:
- Syntax basics
- Input/Output
- Control structures
- Threading or concurrency
- System calls (where applicable)

---

## Purpose

- Provide **hands-on learning** through runnable code samples.
- Act as a **reference or playground** for exploring different programming styles and patterns.
- Help newcomers understand **how core concepts differ or overlap** across languages.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-lab.git
   cd language-lab
   ```

2. Navigate to the language you want to explore:
    ```bash
    cd c/src/
    ```

3. Compile & run (example for C with Make):
    ```
    make
    ./build/loop-example
    ```

üí° Each language folder may include its own Makefile, IDE tasks, or build instructions.

## Requirements

- C/C++: `gcc`, `clang`, or LLVM toolchain
- Java: JDK 8+
- Fortran: `gfortran` or equivalent, ...
- `make` or `cmake` for building (where applicable)
- Basic understanding of programming fundamentals

---

## Samples & Topics

You‚Äôll find samples grouped under folders like:

- `basic/` ‚Äì core syntax, types, loops, functions
- `io/` ‚Äì file and console input/output
- `threading/` ‚Äì simple multithreading examples
- `syscalls/` ‚Äì low-level system interactions (C)
