# 🧪 Language Lab

**Status:** 🛠️ *Active – Educational Sample Code Repository*

---

## 📖 Overview

**Language Lab** is a curated collection of **simple and educational sample programs** organized by language. It’s designed to help learners explore and compare the **basics of programming syntax and features** across multiple languages.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure



Each language folder contains topics such as:
- 📌 Syntax basics
- 📥 Input/Output
- 🔁 Control structures
- 🧵 Threading or concurrency
- 📚 System calls (where applicable)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide **hands-on learning** through runnable code samples.
- Act as a **reference or playground** for exploring different programming styles and patterns.
- Help newcomers understand **how core concepts differ or overlap** across languages.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-lab.git
   cd language-lab
   ```

2. Navigate to the language you want to explore:
    ```bash
    cd c/src/
    ```

3. Compile & run (example for C with Make):
    ```
    make
    ./build/loop-example
    ```

💡 Each language folder may include its own Makefile, IDE tasks, or build instructions.

## 🧰 Requirements

- 🔨 C/C++: `gcc`, `clang`, or LLVM toolchain  
- ☕ Java: JDK 8+  
- 📐 Fortran: `gfortran` or equivalent, ...  
- 🧱 `make` or `cmake` for building (where applicable)
- 🧠 Basic understanding of programming fundamentals  

---

## 🧪 Samples & Topics

You’ll find samples grouped under folders like:

- `basic/` – core syntax, types, loops, functions  
- `io/` – file and console input/output  
- `threading/` – simple multithreading examples  
- `syscalls/` – low-level system interactions (C)  

---

## 🤝 Contributing
