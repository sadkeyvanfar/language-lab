# This script demonstrates file-based inter-process communication (IPC) using locks in Perl.
# It creates a file, writes to it in the parent process, and reads from it in the child process.
# The parent uses an exclusive lock while writing, and the child uses a shared lock while reading.
# This ensures that the child reads the data only after the parent has finished writing.
# The script uses the `flock` function to manage file locks
